        As one humankind, we are struggling to find our new normal, riding the waves of the internet in novel ways to
        solve critical problems. I'm no virologist, but I do have plenty of computers about my house, and an tenet that
        we all have a role to play in the world. I decided to donate my spare resources to a better cause:
        <a href="https://foldingathome.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foldingathome</a>, an old friend
        of mine (since the PlayStation 3 era, at least).
      </p>

      <p>
        Foldingathome is a distributed computing platform that allows computer owners to donate their spare CPU time to
        scientific research. I participated in protein folding calculations in the past, and now the team is using the
        same tech to find answers for SARS-CoV-2. However, tech has come a long way since the launch of the PlayStation
        3.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the "before-times" ended, I've been learning and developing software to <em>simplify serverless</em> for
        <a href="https://jamstack.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamstack</a> deployments. I chose to
        build infrastructure on
        <a href="https://kubernetes.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes</a>, the behemoth of
        container orchestration, due to its limitless deployment
        options. That means I've got a development Kubernetes cluster that isn't near efficient capacity. Thanks to the
        genius of the <a href="https://github.com/richstokes/k8s-fah" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open
          source community</a>, I was able to donate some of my
        spare space in the hopes that science and technology unite to find the answers we so desperately need.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Kubernetes has a chance to help the world, I'm willing to try it.
